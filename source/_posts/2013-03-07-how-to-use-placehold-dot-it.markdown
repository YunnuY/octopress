####Do you ever heard of `PLACEHOLD.IT` ?
<br/>          
####What's `PLACEHOLD.IT` ? A quick and simple image placeholder service.
<!--more-->
<br/>  
####How does it work? Just put your image size after our URL and you'll get a placeholder.    
<br/>  
####Like this: `http://placehold.it/350x150`     
<br/>  
####You can also use it in your code, like this:     
<br/>  
####`<img src="http://placehold.it/350x150">`
<br/>  
####You will get a image placeholder like below:
![Placehold for 350x150](/images/350x150.png)        
####But markdown does not support defining the height and width for the image. so you can choose to use `<image>` tag if need.
<br/>  
####Is it very simple and useful? Have fun!
